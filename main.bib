	Abstract = {The author identifies the strategies that experienced IS project managers say they use to cope with requirements uncertainty on development projects for external clients. He shows that project managers say they use different strategies for coping with the different dimensions of requirements uncertainty, as this construct has been formulated in the literature. He then argues that requirements uncertainty, as this construct has been formulated in the literature. The author then argues that requirements uncertainty should be formulated as a profile construct, and not as a latent or aggregate construct as at present, if it is to have pragmatic validity as a guide to action for project managers},

	Abstract = {t's a plain fact: regardless of how smart, creative, and innovative your organization is, there are more smart, creative, and innovative people outside your organization than inside. Open source offers the possibility of bringing more innovation into your business by building a creative community that reaches beyond the barriers of the business. The key is developing a web-driven community where new types of collaboration and creativity can flourish. Since 1998 Ron Goldman and Richard Gabriel have been helping groups at Sun Microsystems understand open source and advising them on how to build successful communities around open source projects. In this book the authors present lessons learned from their own experiences with open source, as well as those from other well-known projects such as Linux, Apache, and Mozilla.},

	Abstract = {This article introduces a special issue of Software Process - Improvement and Practice focusing on processes found in free or open source software development (F/OSSD) projects. It seeks to provide a background overview of research in this area through a review of selected empirical studies of F/OSSD processes. The results and findings from a survey of empirical studies of F/OSSD give rise to an interesting variety of opportunities and challenges for understanding these processes, which are identified along the way. Overall, what becomes clear is that studies of F/OSSD processes reveal a more diverse set of different types of processes than have typically been examined in conventional software development projects. The articles in this special issue further advance understanding of what processes characterize and shape F/OSSD.},

	Abstract = {Open source practices and tools have proven to be highly effective for overcoming the many problems of geographically distributed software development. We know relatively little, however, about the range of settings in which they work. In particular, can corporations use the open source development model effectively for software projects inside the corporate domain? Or are these tools and practices incompatible with development environments, management practices, and market-driven schedule and feature decisions typical of a commercial software house? We present a case study of open source software development methodology adopted by a significant commercial software project in the telecommunications domain. We extract a number of lessons learned from the experience, and identify open research questions.},

	Abstract = {We report on our experiences of introducing an instant messaging and group chat application into geographically distributed workgroups. We describe a number of issues we encountered, including privacy concerns, individual versus group training, and focusing on teams or individuals. The perception of the tool's utility was a complex issue, depending both on users' views of the importance of informal communication, and their perceptions of the nature of cross-site communication issues. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of critical mass, which is related to the features each user actually uses. More generally, we encountered a dilemma that imposes serious challenges for user-centered design of groupware systems},

@book{xp,
	Abstract = {Kent Beck's <I>eXtreme Programming eXplained</I> provides an intriguing high-level overview of the author's Extreme Programming (XP) software development methodology. Written for IS managers, project leaders, or programmers, this guide provides a glimpse at the principles behind XP and its potential advantages for small- to mid-size software development teams.<p> The book intends to describe what XP is, its guiding principles, and how it works. Simply written, the book avoids case studies and concrete details in demonstrating the efficacy of XP. Instead, it demonstrates how XP relies on simplicity, unit testing, programming in pairs, communal ownership of code, and customer input on software to motivate code improvement during the development process. As the author notes, these principles are not new, but when they're combined their synergy fosters a new and arguably better way to build and maintain software. Throughout the book, the author presents and explains these principles, such as "rapid feedback" and "play to win," which form the basis of XP.<p> Generally speaking, XP changes the way programmers work. The book is good at delineating new roles for programmers and managers who Beck calls "coaches." The most striking characteristic of XP is that programmers work in pairs, and that testing is an intrinsic part of the coding process. In a later section, the author even shows where XP works and where it doesn't and offers suggestions for migrating teams and organizations over to the XP process. <p> In the afterword, the author recounts the experiences that led him to develop and refine XP, an insightful section that should inspire any organization to adopt XP. This book serves as a useful introduction to the philosophy and practice of XP for the manager or programmer who wants a potentially better way to build software. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Extreme Programming (XP) software methodology, principles, XP team roles, facilities design, testing, refactoring, the XP software lifecycle, and adopting XP. Software development projects can be fun, productive, and even daring. Yet they can consistently deliver value to a business and remain under control. <P>Extreme Programming (XP) was conceived and developed to address the specific needs of software development conducted by small teams in the face of vague and changing requirements. This new lightweight methodology challenges many conventional tenets, including the long-held assumption that the cost of changing a piece of software necessarily rises dramatically over the course of time. XP recognizes that projects have to work to achieve this reduction in cost and exploit the savings once they have been earned. <P>Fundamentals of XP include: <P>* Distinguishing between the decisions to be made by business interests and those to be made by project stakeholders. * Writing unit tests before programming and keeping all of the tests running at all times. * Integrating and testing the whole system-several times a day. * Producing all software in pairs, two programmers at one screen. * Starting projects with a simple design that constantly evolves to add needed flexibility and remove unneeded complexity. * Putting a minimal system into production quickly and growing it in whatever directions prove most valuable. <P>Why is XP so controversial? Some sacred cows don't make the cut in XP: <P>* Don't force team members to specialize and become analysts, architects, programmers, testers, and integrators-every XP programmer participates in all of these critical activities every day. * Don't conduct complete up-front analysis and design-an XP project starts with a quick analysis of the entire system, and XP programmers continue to make analysis and design decisions throughout development. * Develop infrastructure and frameworks as you develop your application, not up-front-delivering business value is the heartbeat that drives XP projects. * Don't write and maintain implementation documentation-communication in XP projects occurs face-to-face, or through efficient tests and carefully written code. <P>You may love XP or you may hate it, but Extreme Programming Explained will force you to take a fresh look at how you develop software.},

	Abstract = {Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly. This article is a quick overview of Continuous Integration summarizing the technique and its current usage.},

Multiple users can check out files from a directory tree, make changes, and then commit those changes back into the directory. If two developers modify the same file, CVS enables both sets of changes to be merged together into one final file. Although CVS is a lifesaver in many development scenarios, it suffers from poor documentation. But with <i>Essential CVS</i>, developers can have it all: the order that CVS brings and the comprehensive documentation developers need. <i>Essential CVS</i> is a complete and easy-to-follow reference that helps programmers and system administrators apply order to the task of managing large quantities of documents. The book covers basic concepts and usage of CVS, and features a comprehensive reference for CVS commands--including a handy Command Reference Card for quick, on-the-job checks. The book also includes advanced information on all aspects of CVS that involve automation, logging, branching and merging, and "watches." Readers will find in-depth coverage of the following:<ul> <li>Installing CVS and building your first repository</li> <li>Basic use of CVS, including importing projects, checking out projects, committing changes, and updating projects</li> <li>Tagging, branching and merging</li> <li>Working with multiple users</li> <li>Clients, operating systems, and IDEs</li> <li>Repository management and managing remote repositories</li> <li>Project administration, including bug tracking systems, enforcing log messages, history and annotation, and more.</li> <li>Troubleshooting</li></ul> Version control is essential to maintaining order in any project, large or small. Any CVS user, from beginners to team leaders and system administrators, will find this practical guide to CVS indispensable in getting the most from this valuable tool.},

	Abstract = {One of the greatest frustrations in most software projects is version control: the art of managing changes to information. Today's increasingly fast pace of software development--as programmers make small changes to software one day only to undo them the next--has only heightened the problem; consecutive work on code or single-programmer software is a rare sight these days. Without careful attention to version control, concurrent and collaborative work can create more headaches than it solves. This is where Subversion comes into play. Written by members of the Subversion open source development team, <i>Version Control with Subversion</i> introduces the powerful new versioning tool designed to be the successor to the Concurrent Version System or CVS. CVS users will find the "look and feel" Subversion comfortably familiar, but under the surface it's far more flexible, robust, and usable, and more importantly, it improves on CVS's more notable flaws. The book begins with a general introduction to Subversion, the basic concepts behind version control, and a guided tour of Subversion's capabilities and structure. With thorough attention to detail, the authors cover every aspect of installing and configuring Subversion for managing a programming project, documentation, or any other team-based endeavor. Later chapters cover the more complex topics of branching, repository administration, and other advanced features such as properties, externals, and access control. The book ends with reference material and appendices covering a number of useful topics such as a Subversion complete reference and troubleshooting guide. <i>Version Control with Subversion</i> aims to be useful to readers of widely different backgrounds, from those with no previous experience in version control to experienced sysadmins. If you've never used version control, you'll find everything you need to get started in this book. And if you're a seasoned CVS pro, this book will help you make a painless leap into Subversion.},

	Abstract = {In distributed software development, two sorts of dependencies can arise. The structure of the software system itself can create dependencies between software elements, while the structure of the development process can create dependencies between software developers. Each of these both shapes and reflects the development process. Our research concerns the extent to which, by looking uniformly at artifacts and activities, we can uncover the structures of software projects, and the ways in which development processes are inscribed into software artifacts. We show how a range of organizational processes and arrangements can be uncovered in software repositories, with implications for collaborative work in large distributed groups such as open source communities.},

@article{herbsleb03,
	Abstract = {Global software development is rapidly becoming the norm for technology companies. Previous qualitative research suggests that distributed development may increase development cycle time for individual work items (modification requests). We use both data from the source code change management system and survey data to model the extent of delay in a distributed software development organization and explore several possible mechanisms for this delay. One key finding is that distributed work items appear to take about two and one-half times as long to complete as similar items where all the work is colocated. The data strongly suggest a mechanism for the delay, i.e., that distributed work items involve more people than comparable same-site work items, and the number of people involved is strongly related to the calendar time to complete a work item. We replicate the analysis of change data in a different organization with a different product and different sites and confirm our main findings. We also report survey results showing differences between same-site and distributed social networks, testing several hypotheses about characteristics of distributed social networks that may be related to delay. We discuss implications of our findings for practices and collaboration technology that have the potential for dramatically speeding distributed software development.},

Researchers performed a global Web survey of IT departments in 2005 and 2007. The results suggest that the software crisis is perhaps exaggerated and that most software projects deliver. However, the overall project failure rate, including cancelled and completed but poorly performing projects, remains arguably high for an applied discipline.},

The scenario is worst in Pakistan having very immature software industry where projects are mostly over budgeted, over scheduled, and get low customer satisfaction. Organizations are spending a lot on project management training to make their projects successful but still the rate of software projects failure is very high. Project manager's knowledge, skills, and experiences are just not giving required results. This paper is based on the results of a survey conducted about the skill set of software project mangers, their experience and education level, and success rate of their projects. The conclusions are made about the required skill set of technical as well as non technical project managers of Pakistan in particular and of the world in general.},

	Abstract = {The failure rate of software projects has been proven to be very high, and the incidence of failure is becoming worse as more companies venture into software development. Risk management is a collection of methods aimed at minimising or reducing the effects of project failure. This research report has focused on experienced project manager's perceptions of software project risks and controls. It reports on the more significant risks and controls that are utilised to reduce the occurrence of the risk factors, or minimise the impact of various risks. Risk factors involved in software projects along with controls to mitigate these factors were identified in the literature. These were then used in an empirical study to determine their importance and frequency of occurrence. The effectiveness of various controls to reduce the occurrence of risk factors was also identified and discussed. Experienced project managers were found to use certain controls more than inexperienced project managers, particularly 'assign responsibilities to team members' and 'stabilise requirements and specifications'.},

@article{cerpa09,
	Abstract = {We have been developing software since the 1960s but still have not learned enough to ensure that our software development projects are successful. Boehm2 suggested that realistic schedule and budgets together with a continuing steam of requirements changes are high risk factors. The Standish Group in 1994 noted that approximately 31% of corporate software development projects were cancelled before completion and 53% were challenged and cost 180% above their original estimate.13 Glass discussed 16 project disasters.5 He found that the failed projects he reviewed were mostly huge and that the failure factors were not just management factors but also included technical factors. Linberg in 1999 found that 20% of software projects failed, and that 46% experienced cost and schedule overruns or significantly reduced functionality.8 Later, Glass revisited failed projects and found that poor estimation was high on his list of failure factors.6

In 2007 the Standish Group reported that 35% of software projects started in 2006 were successful compared with only 16% in the corresponding 1994 report; however, the 2007 CHAOS report still identifies 46% (53% in 1994) of software projects as challenged (having cost or time overruns or not fully meeting user's requirements) and 19% (31% in 1994) as outright failures.12 The validity of the Standish Group findings has been questioned as not consistent with cost overrun results of other surveys.7 J{\o}rgensen and Mol{\o}kken-{\O}stvold suggested that there are serious problems with the way the Standish Group conducted their research and that the findings were biased toward reports of failure because a random sample of top IT executives was asked to share failure stories when mailed confidential surveys.

Recently Charette4 commented that "billions of dollars are wasted each year on failed software projects" and that "we have a dismal history of projects that have gone awry."4 Charette suggests that from 5%-15% of projects will be abandoned before or shortly after delivery as hopelessly inadequate.4 Other recent studies, suggest various failure rates for software development projects up to 85%.7 Stories of software failure capture public attention and in general there is a perception that software quality is not improving but getting worse.

Developing software systems is an expensive, and often a difficult process. Although there are many guidelines for successful software development,9,11 few project post-mortems are conducted, and little understanding is gained from the results of past projects. The project manager (PM) and the development team must deal with many pressures from project stakeholders (for example, upper level management, marketing, accounting, customers, and users) during the software development process. These pressures impact both the cost and the quality of the software produced. There are generally more than one or two reasons for a software project to fail, and it usually is a combination of technical, project management and business decisions. Many software project failure factors have been described in the literature.1-13 However, most organizations do not see preventing failure as an urgent matter. It is not understood why this attitude persists.4

Because most of the literature is based on a handful of failed project case studies, in our research we analyze 70 failed software projects to determine those practices that affected project outcome. We are interested in providing, from the perspective of software practitioners, quantitative evidence targeting those aspects of the development process that contribute to project failure. Essentially, we are interested in updating the results of prior studies and testing the validity of previously reported anecdotal evidence. To date, no one has taken a set of project data and teased it out to identify, for a whole group of such projects, the most common failure factors. We are interested in everyday projects that are not high profile enough to be reported in the literature. Our work builds on that previously reported by Boehm,2 Charette,4 Glass,5,6 J{\o}rgensen and Mol{\o}kken,7 Linberg,8 and the Standish Group,12,13 among others.

The aim of this paper is to find a connection between successful projects and team properties. Early recognition would be useful when the teacher or team instructor tries to help the teams to overcome possible obstacles caused by personal or team weaknesses. We gathered a vast amount of data on 40 students during selected capstone projects with questionnaires, interviews and expert observation over five semesters. The paper shows our measurement technique and its ability to reflect success in the capstone projects.

Close examination of the data revealed that certain team properties and operations were more significant in relation to expert evaluation than other. These factors are called high-impact factors for successful projects. Most significant were pre-learned skills in Computer Science curriculum, communication, coordination, and teamwork. Some success signs were evident from the beginning of the projects, including attitudes and personal needs},

	Abstract = {When important projects fail, the investigation is often focused on the engineering and technical reasons for the failure. That was the case in NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter (MCO) that was lost in space after completing its nine-month journey to Mars. Yet, in many cases the root cause of the failure is not technical, but managerial. Often the problem is rooted in management's failure to select the right approach to the specific project. The objective of this paper is to enrich our understanding of project failure due to managerial reasons by utilizing different contingency theory frameworks for a retrospective look at unsuccessful projects and perhaps more important, potential prevention of future failures. The evolving field of project management contingency theory provides an opportunity at this time to re-examine the concept of fit between project characteristics and project management, and offer deeper insights on why projects fail. After outlining several existing contingency studies, we use three distinct frameworks for analyzing the MCO project. These frameworks include Henderson and Clark's categorization of change and innovation, Shenhar and Dvir's NTCP diamond framework, and Pich, Loch, and De Meyer's strategies for managing uncertainty. While each framework provides a different perspective, collectively, they demonstrate that in the MCO program, the choices made by managers, or more accurately, the constraints imposed on them under the policy of 'better, faster, cheaper', led the program to its inevitable failure. This paper shows that project management contingency theory can indeed provide new insights for a deeper understanding of project failure. Furthermore, it suggests implications for a richer upfront analysis of a project's unique characteristics of uncertainty and risk, as well as additional directions of research. Such research may help establish new and different conceptions on project success and failure beyond the traditional success factors, and subsequently develop more refined contingency frameworks. The results of such research may enable future project managers to rely less on heuristics and possibly lead to a new application of '' project management design.''},

	Abstract = {This study surveyed 497 participants to determine the factors that affect project professionals' acceptance of project management software and the perceived impact of software usage on their performance. The study finds that greater information quality and higher project complexity are the dominant factors explaining higher levels of system utilization, that greater system functionality and ease of use have a significant positive relationship with increased software usage, and that a strong positive relationship exists between higher usage of project management software and perceived project managers' improved performance. Inconsistent with prior research, more training was not found to be associated with project management software usage. The study explains more than 40\% of the variation in project management software acceptance and adds project management software usage to project success factors by empirically confirming for the first time that project management software enhances project professionals' perceived performance and provides a positive impact on the results of their projects. The study provides practical implications for project professionals, their organizations, senior management, decision makers, software developers, and vendors. These findings support the call for further research that investigates the diffusion of information technologies in the project management field and their impact on project success and competitive position.},

	Abstract = {Project management information systems (PMIS) usually acquired by organizations as software packages are meant to provide managers with the decision-making support needed in planning, organizing, and controlling projects. However, the actual contribution of PMIS to project success or performance is still unknown. The purpose of this study is to empirically assess the quality of the PMIS presently used in organizations and to examine their impact on project managers and project performance, based on a PMIS success model. This model is composed of five constructs: the quality of the PMIS, the quality of the PMIS information output, the use of the PMIS, the individual impacts of the PMIS and the impacts of the PMIS on project success. Analysis of questionnaire data obtained from 39 project managers confirms the significant contribution of PMIS to successful project management. Improvements in effectiveness and efficiency in managerial tasks were observed here in terms of better project planning, scheduling, monitoring, and control. Improvements were also observed in terms of timelier decision-making. Advantages obtained from PMIS use are not limited to individual performance but also include project performance. These systems were found to have direct impacts on project success, as they contribute to improving budget control and meeting project deadlines as well as fulfilling technical specifications.},

	Abstract = {Organizations increasingly use projects to achieve business objectives but report that results often fall short of goals. A number of formal standards for managing projects have been developed intending to improve such project outcomes. However, research examining this assumption is scarce and has yielded mixed results. This paper presents the development and use of a set of metrics for assessing the use of project management (PM) practices in an empirical assessment of the relative use of different practices, and the link between the use of those practices and project success. Our analysis shows widely varying usage of different PM practices and differences in use depending on the context of the project. Further, our study indicates that the level of use of PM practices is indeed related to project success. Finally, the results suggest that the PM practices that make a difference may not be the most frequently used.},

	Abstract = {Fault-based testing strategies test software by focusing on specific, common types of faults. The coupling effect hypothesizes that test data sets that detect simple types of faults are sensitive enough to detect more complex types of faults. This paper describes empirical investigations into the coupling effect over a specific class of software faults. All of the results from this investigation support the validity of the coupling effect. The major conclusion from this investigation is the fact that by explicitly testing for simple faults, we are also implicitly testing for more complicated faults, giving us confidence that fault-based testing is an effective way to test software.},

	Abstract = {The Value-Based Software Engineering (VBSE) agenda described in the preceding article has the objectives of integrating value considerations into current and emerging software engineering principles and practices, and of developing an overall framework in which they compatibly reinforce each other. In this paper, we provide a case study illustrating some of the key VBSE practices, and focusing on a particular anomaly in the monitoring and control area: the "Earned Value Management System." This is a most useful technique for monitoring and controlling the cost, schedule, and progress of a complex project. But it has absolutely nothing to say about the stakeholder value of the system being developed. The paper introduces an example order-processing software project, and shows how the use of Benefits Realization Analysis, stake-holder value proposition elicitation and reconciliation, and business case analysis provides a framework for stakeholder-earned-value monitoring and control.},

	Abstract = {An organizational level test strategy needs to incorporate metrics to make the testing activities visible and available to process improvements. The majority of testing measurements that are done are based on faults found in the test execution phase. In contrast, this paper investigates metrics to support software test planning and test design processes. We have assembled metrics in these two process types to support management in carrying out evidence-based test process improvements and to incorporate suitable metrics as part of an organization level test strategy. The study is composed of two steps. The first step creates a relevant context by analyzing key phases in the software testing lifecycle, while the second step identifies the attributes of software test planning and test design processes along with metric(s) support for each of the identified attributes.},

	Abstract = {Defect Prediction Models aim at identifying error-prone parts of a software system as early as possible. Many such models have been proposed, their evaluation, however, is still an open question, as recent publications show.

An important aspect often ignored during evaluation is the effort reduction gained by using such models. Models are usually evaluated per module by performance measures used in information retrieval, such as recall, precision, or the area under the ROC curve (AUC). These measures assume that the costs associated with additional quality assurance activities are the same for each module, which is not reasonable in practice. For example, costs for unit testing and code reviews are roughly proportional to the size of a module.

In this paper, we investigate this discrepancy using optimal and trivial models. We describe a trivial model that takes only the module size measured in lines of code into account, and compare it to five classification methods. The trivial model performs surprisingly well when evaluated using AUC. However, when an effort-sensitive performance measure is used, it becomes apparent that the trivial model is in fact the worst.},

@article{fenton99,
	Abstract = {Many organizations want to predict the number of defects (faults) in software systems, before they are deployed, to gauge the likely delivered quality and maintenance effort. To help in this numerous software metrics and statistical models have been developed, with a correspondingly large literature. We provide a critical review of this literature and the state-of-the-art. Most of the wide range of prediction models use size and complexity metrics to predict defects. Others are based on testing data, the "quality" of the development process, or take a multivariate approach. The authors of the models have often made heroic contributions to a subject otherwise bereft of empirical studies. However, there are a number of serious theoretical and practical problems in many studies. The models are weak because of their inability to cope with the, as yet, unknown relationship between defects and failures. There are fundamental statistical and data quality problems that undermine model validity. More significantly many prediction models tend to model only part of the underlying problem and seriously misspecify it. To illustrate these points the "Goldilock's Conjecture," that there is an optimum module size, is used to show the considerable problems inherent in current defect prediction approaches. Careful and considered analysis of past and new results shows that the conjecture lacks support and that some models are misleading. We recommend holistic models for software defect prediction, using Bayesian Belief Networks, as alternative approaches to the single-issue models used at present. We also argue for research into a theory of "software decomposition" in order to test hypotheses about defect introduction and help construct a better science of software engineering.},

	Abstract = {Defects discovered during the testing phase in software projects need to be removed before the software is shipped to the customers. The removal of defects can constitute a significant amount of effort in a project and project managers are faced with a decision whether to continue development or shift some resources to cope with defect removal. The goal of this research is to improve the practice of project management by providing a method for predicting the number of defects reported into the defect database in the project. In this paper we present a method for predicting the number of defects reported into the defect database in a large software project on a weekly basis. The method is based on using project progress data, in particular the information about the test progress, to predict defect inflow in the next three coming weeks. The results show that the prediction accuracy of our models is up to 72% (mean magnitude of relative error for predictions of 1 week in advance is 28%) when used in ongoing large software projects. The method is intended to support project managers in more accurate adjusting resources in the project, since they are notified in advance about the potentially large effort needed to correct defects.},
